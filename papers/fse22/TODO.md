# Reviews AST 

- Explain mutation operators in detail (in appendix and/or main text)

- We should argue that exhaustive mutation is a good idea if we can make it "on
  demand" -- inspired by Lazy Small Check. So, potentially all the mutation will
  be carried out, but that does not mean that we will do it. 

- We should add some LOC or some metric that indicates the "size" of the systems
  under test

## IFC case study 

- Threat to validity: a review has a point that we should discuss why our
  reimplementation of the IFC case study is / is not a treat to validity. 

- Describe the type of bugs for IFC. I know they are generated at random but we
  should give a feeling about what they could be.
